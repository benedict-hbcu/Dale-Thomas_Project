### Dale-Thomas_Project

#### ServiceNow Bootcamp Spring 2023 Project 

##### Brief Summary

Demi Dale and Ostonya Thomas are collaborating on a unique apologetics platform. With Christianity rapidly declining in the US, the faith is becoming more and more misunderstood by unbelievers. The goal of this project is to create an interface that allows the public to get a glimpse of what it means to be a Christian through answering questions and showing social media posts depicting the lives of Christians today.

##### One Pager

In 1972 92% of Americans said they were Christian, but it is projected that by 2070 that number will drop to below 50%. Christianity is experiencing a sharp decline and with the multitude of controversial views held by the faith, people are steadily misunderstanding Christianity. Today Christians are perceived as closed-minded, and their lifestyle is widely misconceived. While this may be a time where the numbers are declining for Christianity, this is also a time where the world, especially Gen Z, is exceptionally open-minded. The world would be a much better place if more people understood what Christianity is. To diminish the negative connotations surrounding the faith by showing people who are clueless about the faith what Christianity is about and who a Christian is while inviting them to join the family would be the holy grail.

Ideally, this platform would be hosted by a local church. This platform will be a visually pleasing and easy to use webpage that helps users learn more about Christianity through interacting with media from popular social media platforms, such as memes, music, TikTokâ€™s, etc. Through interacting with these various forms of media which depict Christianity, people should be able to understand it as a way of life rather than a religion or negative character trait.

There are many websites which try to inform the public of the Good News and answers some of the hard questions. Some sites like this are christianityexplored.org, Christianity.org and some other church websites. Our platform differs from most others in that it will allow users a more immersive experience of the kingdom culture and cover a broader scope of uncertainty.

The goal of this project is to inform those with little to no knowledge of Christianity. While Christians may find this content enjoyable, they already have access to most of this media because they are likely already following and subscribed to popular Christian pages and accounts. As a result, most of the traffic, at any given moment, on this platform would be from non-believers or new believers. Thus, one reason this may fail is if non-believers and new believers are completely uninterested in learning about the Christian way of life or are unaware a platform like this exists.
