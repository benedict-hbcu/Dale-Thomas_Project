People often decide to build their own houses to allow their dreams to become reality or to get more bang for their buck. Usually, draftsmen, architects, or home designers serve as the medium allowing someone’s dream home to be laid out on paper. Imagine if a medium was not needed to place a dream on paper. The goal of DIY Planner is to allow one with no background in architecture or design to build one’s own floor plan, thus allowing a more intimate experience in the home design process.

 Rather than in the usual process of floor planning where the architect seems like the writer and the dreamer seems like the editor, the roles can be reversed. This product will allow a floor plan which a user designed to be sent directly to a draftsman, architect, or home designer affiliated with the host site to get approved for use or receive edits and/or recommendations. An ideal setting for this tool would be a well-known hardware store such as Home Depot or Lowe’s. 

This product will be an easy-to-use website that allows users to design houses by interacting with buttons. Users will be able choose how many floors houses will have. A good website would have a nice balance between being easy to use and being flexible. This means that it should be easy to use, but not restrict the user from being creative in the design process. The user will also be able to view the creation in 2D as well as 3D. 
  
Some competitors in this market include Floorplanner, Sketchup, and Sweet Home 3D. Of these three, Floorplanner is the biggest competitor due to its user-friendly interface and visual appeal. This product will differ from its competitors in that it will offer features that these competitors do not offer individually (such as converting a 2D plan to 3D and pricing based on materials). A key difference is that this product will allow one to get feedback on one’s own floorplan from a professional.
  
The smallest version of this product should be able to perform the basic task of allowing an individual to create a single-story house. It should also be able to allow the user to export the product and send it to the professionals affiliated with the host site for review.

This product could fail in the future due to people resorting to other similar products such as Floorplanner. Also, with inflation on the rise, fewer people can afford to build houses, thus there may be a low demand for the service. Finally, there is always the possibility that potential customers are unaware such a service exists and resort to having floorplans done by draftsmen, architects, and home designers.
